## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why would I need this plugin?
If you need to manually clear server-side caches every time you modify your site, or want to automate cache clearing, this plugin is for you. It provides a "set it and forget it" solution for cache management.

### Does it work with my hosting provider?
The plugin supports most major WordPress hosting providers. Check the features list above for your specific host. Some integrations may require additional plugins or configurations.

### Can I choose which caches to purge?
Yes! The plugin includes settings to select which types of caches should be purged, giving you granular control over the purging process.

### What about performance impact?
The plugin uses WooCommerce's Action Scheduler to handle purging in the background, minimizing impact on your site's performance. Long-running purge operations are handled via WordPress cron jobs.

### Does it support multisite?
Yes, the plugin is compatible with WordPress multisite installations.

## Important Notes

### NitroPack Integration
NitroPack has its own methodology for clearing and managing most server-based caches. As a result, we cannot log items that NitroPack removes, overwrites, manages, or flushes during its purge processes.

### PHP Dynamic Properties Notice
The Fastly CDN integration may generate PHP 8 notices about Dynamic Properties. This is a known issue with the Fastly library that will be resolved when Fastly updates their code.

### Performance Considerations
- Long purge operations are moved to background processing to avoid admin interface slowdowns
- Cron-based scheduling prevents performance issues during high-traffic periods
- Logging can be disabled to improve performance if detailed purge tracking isn't needed

**Performance Tip**: This plugin works best when you configure only the cache types you actually use. Unnecessary purging operations can be disabled in the settings to optimize performance.

**Compatibility Note**: While this plugin attempts to support as many caching systems as possible, some hosting providers may have unique implementations. If you experience issues, contact your hosting provider to confirm cache clearing methods and any required additional plugins.
