Do you need to manually clear your server-side caches everytime you modify your site, what about automating it, or need to do it in CLI?  If yes, then this is for you.  

= How do I utilize the CLI cache clearing? =

Shell into your server and run the command `wp the_cache purge`.  Please note that if you are a root user, you may need to add the `--allow-root` argument.  Also note, that if yout site is a network, you will need to add the url argument for the site you want to purge... `--url=http(s)://yoursite.com`
